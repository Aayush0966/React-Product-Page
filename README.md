## üí° How it works

1. The app fetches products from a dummy JSON API and displays them in a list format.
2. Users can search for products using the search bar, filter by categories, and click on individual products to view more details.
3. The cart system allows users to add/remove items and view their cart contents.
4. Global state is managed using **Redux**, and **Tailwind CSS** is used for styling the application.
